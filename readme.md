## General info

I've decided to complete this project in order to put my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and GIT into practice. I based it on the template provided by [@flynerdpl](https://www.flynerd.pl/). It helped me learn how to design a legible CV with HTML5 and CSS, using CSS flexbox layout, RWD and Font Awesome for social media.
